# DrawerLayout

A React component that adds a collapsible and flexible
drawer with a viewport. It uses render props to delegate
rendering outside itself, therefore separation of concerns!

<Props of={DrawerLayout}/>

Here's an example with a string for drawer content.

<Preview>
    <Story name="with string" height="10rem">
        <DrawerLayout
            drawer="Here is drawer content.">
            <article>
                <h2>
                    Good morning :)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is some other content, rendered next to it.
                    Usually, you put your main content here.
                </p>
            </article>
        </DrawerLayout>
    </Story>
</Preview>

And here it is closed.

<Preview>
    <Story name="closed" height="10rem">
        <DrawerLayout
            open={false}>
            <article>
                <h2>
                    Good morning :)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is some other content, rendered next to it.
                    Usually, you put your main content here.
                </p>
            </article>
        </DrawerLayout>
    </Story>
</Preview>
