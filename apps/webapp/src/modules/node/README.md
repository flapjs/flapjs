# NodeGraph
This is a Flap.js module for constructing a general graph of nodes and edges.

## Motivation
The NodeGraph module will allow users to construct a graph using nodes and connected edges and export them for use in other applications. This is basically a base starting off point for most other modules.

## Goals
- [x] NodeGraph Module

## Entrypoints
The class NodeGraphModule.js is the main entrypoint. From here, any setup and cleanup are performed here or further delegated to other classes.

## Don'ts & Dangers
- Nothing as of yet.

## Changelog
**10/5/19 - Andrew:**
Refactored the module to use the new session system.

**5/20/19 - Andrew:**
This is the first entry for the NodeGraph module. It can create and export node graphs similar to those made in the FSA module.
