# So You Want to be the Team Member?
Hello and welcome to the team! Either you have been chosen as an official team member of Flap.js, or you like to read documentation a little too much. Either way, congrats! It will be an exciting and enlightening journey and I wish you the best of luck. ;)

To hopefully help you out, I've documented below my experiences I've gathered from being part of the team myself. Many of these I've experienced myself, and their results are documented below. But of course, not every team is the same. Some of these may be hugely successful practices but fails miserably for you. I would suggest you read it but take what you see fit. Or try some out! Feel free to experiment and play around with different ideas. This is your chance to figure out how to be a good software team member. Good luck!

_NOTE: I hope you recognize the importance of documentation, especially internal documentation. For any project, whether it'd be building a bridge or creating a website, it is always about the people. Documentation helps bridge the gap between the code and its users. If this was helpful, I hope when you leave you will contribute to this document for future team members to come. Experience is hard to come by and this is the perfect opportunity to contribute your take on collaboration._
