#So you want to contribute?
Well, your in luck, cause that's what this is for! :D

Hello people of [insert your year here]! Here at Flap.js we strive to refine our skills as creative programmers and explore new boundaries of computing and collaboration through web development.

This is a learning environment, but we do want to make sure we excercise to our utmost ability our software engineering principles in constructing maintainable (and fun) software. This means teamwork and documentation is just as important, if not more, as the code you write. We can do far greater things together than alone.

Note: If you are interested in more of these practices, checkout Professor Powell's class of CSE 112 Advanced Software Engineering; it takes you on a wild ride ;)
