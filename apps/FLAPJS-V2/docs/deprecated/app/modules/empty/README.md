# Empty
This is a Flap.js module for doing nothing. Literally, it does nothing, but hopefully it can help you figure out what a barebones module looks like. :D

## Motivation
The Empty module will allow users to do absolutely, positively nothing. It is simply an example module for developers to refer to or look at.

## Goals
- [x] Empty Module

## Entrypoints
The class EmptyModule.js is the main entrypoint. From here, any setup and cleanup are performed here or further delegated to other classes.

## Don'ts & Dangers
- Nothing. It doesn't have anything in it.

## Changelog

**5/20/19 - Andrew:**
This is the first entry for the Empty module. Since its conception from a while back, really nothing much has changed. Effectively, you can treat this as the first version, even though it may be almost as old as the FSA module.
