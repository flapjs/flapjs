# So you want to contribute?
Well, you're in luck, cause that's what this is for! :D

Hello people of [insert your year here]! Here at Flap.js we strive to refine our skills as creative programmers and explore new boundaries of computing and collaboration through web development.

This is a learning environment, but we do want to make sure we excercise to our utmost ability our software engineering principles in constructing maintainable (and fun) software. This means teamwork and documentation is just as important, if not more, as the code you write. We can do far greater things together than alone.

Note: If you are interested in more of these practices, checkout Professor Powell's class, CSE 112 Advanced Software Engineering; it takes you on a wild ride ;)

## Get familiar with the code base
This is a rather large code base, and it is a daunting task sometimes to find what you are looking for. If we did this correctly, you should be able to refer to the many documentation files in the `docs` folder anytime you are lost about something. In particular, check out the `DIRECTORIES.md` file for what each folder in the project means. This way, you can get a better sense of direction when fixing or adding new features! In the `docs`, there are also various tutorials we've either fished out from the Internet or wrote ourselves to catch you up on the frameworks and tools we use. And there's plenty more other helpful tidbits in there! Feel free to take a look at other docs that seem interesting :D

## Get to know the components
Once you've got a handle on where everything is, you may notice that we use `Storybook`. It's a great tool for not only testing, but also documentation. If you open the generated storybook docs we have in `docs/storybook` you should be able to see all the components available for you to use in the project. Each one shows you what it looks like and what it's suppose to do. You can even change all it's props at the bottom of the screen using something called "knobs". These update the component dynamically so you can play around with the component and see what it can do.
