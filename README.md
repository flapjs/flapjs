> By the students. For the students.

**ANNOUNCEMENT:** We are always looking for interested contributors and new members for the team! If you have any interest in web development, UI/UX design, computation theory, or general graphing systems, please contact us. We encourage you to play around with our repo and try out its features! (For more info, go to the bottom of this page.)

## Purpose
To make a program that is more accessible and intuitive to use, so we can all become a [JFLAP](http://www.jflap.org/)-free homework group for Professor Minnesâ€™s class (CSE 105).

## Getting Started
Check out our [docs](https://github.com/flapjs/webapp/tree/master/docs) folder for more detailed and comprehensive tutorials, information, examples, etc.

Here's a TL;DR to get you started quickly:
1. Install your favorite text editor (anything that can handle JavaScript, HTML, and CSS would be nice, but not necessary).
2. We use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Setup them up accordingly.
3. For sanity checking, we use ESlint and Stylelint. If you can add them to your editor that would be nice to have, but, once again, not necessary. These checks will be performed during testing.
4. For testing, we use [jest](https://jestjs.io/). No installation is necessary, but do be familiar on how to use it.
5. Create a project root directory `flapjs`. This should contain all related repos (such as `flapjs/webapp` or `flapjs/welcome`).
6. Clone your repo into `flapjs`.
7. Now all setup is complete, we must run `npm install` for the cloned repo to prepare all project dependencies.
8. The entry point is `src/main.js`. From there, you can now get started on your adventure! **Happy coding!**
