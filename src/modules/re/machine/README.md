It's basically a way to tell the story of the Human-ness of Computer Science, what most often people miss when working in this field.

Starts with one person. Ways to experience the human interface with programming.
- Solving your own human problems.
- Creating something useful to someone.
- Solving someoneâ€™s problem.
- Teaching someone.
- Working together.
- UX/UI
- DX

Psst. Spoilers ahead. This is still under construction. Please hold off reading this. Thank you.

## ComplexStateMachine

// NOTE: Okay. So I didn't write this code, but I'm leaving a trail of what I understand for 
// future reference (and you folks, cause I'm too nice).

// NOTE: From what I understand, this is suppose to calculate 

// I think this is the entrypoint. Someone verify this?
export function main()
{
    
}

function compute()
{

}
