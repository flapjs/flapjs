        <!-- An intuitive web app to help you explore what it means to be computable. Experiment and construct formal languages from finite automata to Turing machines with real-time analysis and error checking. From its humble beginnings as a small tool built by a determined CSE 105 homework group at UC San Diego inspired by JFLAP, it has continued to still be developed by the students, for the students. -->
