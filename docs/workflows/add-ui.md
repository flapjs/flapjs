# How To Add UI Components - INCOMPLETE

## Prerequisite
1. There are 2 ways to create UI components (there are actually more but we are only going to cover the usual way to go about this): Functional and Classes. As of today, React is planning to switch over to Functional Components, so that will be the method we will be using. Some older components may still be written as Class Components, so it may be useful to know how to read it.
2. All React UI components are written in `.jsx` files. You can find other UI component files in `src/components/` for references on how they are structured (in particular, the `lib` file is more self-contained and a good place to start).
3. There are 3 things that make up a UI component:
    - HTML (used in React as JSX). This is used to structure each component.
    - CSS. This is used to style each component.
    - JavaScript. This is used to add logic to each component.

## Doing it
1. Let's make a "Hello World" button that prints "Hello World" when you click it. Create a component file called `HelloWorld.jsx`.
2. Create a CSS module file called `HelloWorld.module.css`;
