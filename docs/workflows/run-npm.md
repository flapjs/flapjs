# Commands You Should Know for NPM

### To get started on any new NPM project
```sh
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies listed in `package.json` and prepare the workspace for you and your system. This sometimes takes a while.

> NOTE: If you get stuck, or find some weird issue with NPM, often times it can be fixed by deleting `node_modules` (which is never committed to the repo, by the way) and `package-lock.json` (which is auto-generated by NPM) and re-running `npm install` again for a clean, fresh start.

Once complete successfully, you can then start up a development build:

```sh
npm start
```

And the app should be running :)

### To install a new package
```sh
npm install --save-dev your_package_name
```
> NOTE: If you are installing a PRODUCTION package, use `--save` instead,
otherwise you should always use `--save-dev`.

### To check what package is outdated
```sh
npm outdated
```

### To update a package to the latest one
```sh
npm install --save-dev your_outdated_package@latest
```

### To run a NPM script
```sh
npm run name-of-script
```

This will run any script by name listed in `package.json` under `scripts`. There are already a few there pre-defined for your convenience. If you are adding a new package that has some command that is used often, consider adding it as another NPM script.
